## Multi-Chain Token Balance Checking Implementation Guide

### Overview

The ZAO Nexus portal implements a robust multi-chain token balance checking system that allows users to connect their wallets and verify token balances across different blockchain networks. The implementation checks for:

- **$ZAO tokens** on the **Optimism** network
- **$LOANZ tokens** on the **Base** network

Users gain access to the portal if they hold at least 0.1 tokens of either type.

### Architecture

#### Core Components

1. **Wallet Hook (`use-wallet.ts`)**: Central hook that manages wallet connection and token balance checking
2. **Wallet Store**: Zustand store with persistence middleware for maintaining wallet state
3. **Wallet Connect Component**: UI component for wallet connection
4. **Token Balance Display**: UI components for showing token balances

### Implementation Best Practices

#### 1. Provider Management

```typescript
// Cache providers to avoid creating new instances on every check
let providers = {
  optimism: null as ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider | null,
  base: null as ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider | null
};

// Cache contracts to avoid creating new instances on every check
let contracts = {
  zao: null as ethers.Contract | null,
  loanz: null as ethers.Contract | null
};

// Initialize providers and contracts
const initializeProviders = () => {
  if (!providers.optimism) {
    providers.optimism = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider(OPTIMISM_RPC);
  }
  if (!providers.base) {
    providers.base = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider(BASE_RPC);
  }
  if (!contracts.zao && providers.optimism) {
    contracts.zao = new ethers.Contract(ZAO_TOKEN_ADDRESS, ERC20_ABI, providers.optimism);
  }
  if (!contracts.loanz && providers.base) {
    contracts.loanz = new ethers.Contract(LOANZ_TOKEN_ADDRESS, ERC20_ABI, providers.base);
  }
};
```

#### 2. Efficient Balance Checking

```typescript
checkTokenBalance: async () => {
  const { address, lastChecked } = get();
  if (!address) return;
  
  // Throttle balance checks to prevent too many RPC calls
  if (Date.now() - lastChecked < 10000) return; // 10 seconds cooldown
  set({ lastChecked: Date.now() });
  
  initializeProviders();
  
  // Use Promise.allSettled to check both balances in parallel
  const results = await Promise.allSettled([
    // Check ZAO balance on Optimism
    (async () => {
      try {
        const balance = await contracts.zao.balanceOf(address);
        return { balance: formatBalance(balance), hasToken: balance.gte(ethers.utils.parseEther("0.1")) };
      } catch (error) {
        console.error("Error checking ZAO balance:", error);
        return { balance: '0', hasToken: false };
      }
    })(),
    
    // Check LOANZ balance on Base
    (async () => {
      try {
        const balance = await contracts.loanz.balanceOf(address);
        return { balance: formatBalance(balance), hasToken: balance.gte(ethers.utils.parseEther("0.1")) };
      } catch (error) {
        console.error("Error checking LOANZ balance:", error);
        return { balance: '0', hasToken: false };
      }
    })()
  ]);
  
  // Update state with results
  if (results[0].status === 'fulfilled') set({ zaoBalance: results[0].value.balance });
  if (results[1].status === 'fulfilled') set({ loanzBalance: results[1].value.balance });
  set({ hasTokens: (results[0].status === 'fulfilled' && results[0].value.hasToken) || 
                   (results[1].status === 'fulfilled' && results[1].value.hasToken) });
}
```

#### 3. Wallet Connection Event Handling

```typescript
// Set up event listeners for account and chain changes
if (typeof window !== 'undefined' && window.ethereum) {
  window.ethereum.on('accountsChanged', async (accounts: string[]) => {
    if (accounts.length === 0) {
      // User disconnected their wallet
      disconnect();
    } else {
      // User switched accounts
      set({ address: accounts[0] });
      await checkTokenBalance();
    }
  });

  window.ethereum.on('chainChanged', async () => {
    // Refresh token balances when chain changes
    await checkTokenBalance();
  });
}
```

#### 4. State Persistence

```typescript
export const useWalletStore = create<WalletState>(
  persist(
    (set, get) => ({
      // State and methods here
    }),
    {
      name: 'wallet-storage', // unique name for localStorage
      partialize: (state) => ({ 
        address: state.address,
        isConnected: state.isConnected,
        zaoBalance: state.zaoBalance,
        loanzBalance: state.loanzBalance,
        hasTokens: state.hasTokens
      })
    }
  )
);
```

### Workflow

1. **User Connects Wallet**:
   - User clicks "Connect Wallet" button
   - Application requests wallet connection via MetaMask
   - On successful connection, wallet address is stored

2. **Balance Checking**:
   - Application initializes providers and contracts if not already done
   - Balances for both tokens are checked in parallel
   - Results are stored in the wallet state

3. **Token Gating**:
   - If user has sufficient tokens (≥ 0.1 of either token), access is granted
   - Token balances are displayed in the UI

## Next Steps

1. **Integration with Main UI**:
   - Integrate the token checker components into the main Nexus UI
   - Ensure consistent styling and user experience

2. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Implement RPC request batching/multicall for more efficient blockchain queries
   - Add caching mechanisms to reduce redundant balance checks

3. **Testing and Validation**:
   - Add unit tests for token balance checker utility functions
   - Add integration tests for wallet connection and token checking flows
   - Test with various wallet states and network conditions

4. **Enhanced Error Handling**:
   - Implement more detailed error messages for specific failure scenarios
   - Add recovery mechanisms for temporary RPC failures

5. **Feature Expansion**:
   - Support additional tokens and networks as needed
   - Add transaction history for token transfers
   - Implement token price information

4. **Event Handling**:
   - Application listens for account and chain changes
   - Balances are rechecked when these events occur

5. **State Persistence**:
   - Wallet state is persisted in localStorage
   - User remains connected across page refreshes

### Troubleshooting

- **Balance Not Updating**: Check browser console for errors. Ensure RPC endpoints are functioning.
- **Connection Issues**: Verify MetaMask is installed and unlocked. Check for network connectivity.
- **Performance Problems**: If balance checks are slow, consider increasing the throttle time.

## Admin Utilities

The project includes several admin utilities for managing links data. These utilities are located in the `src/admin` directory and can be run using Node.js.

### Batch Import Utility

The batch import utility allows importing multiple links from a CSV or JSON file. It supports validation, deduplication, and automatic categorization.

#### Usage

```bash
# Run the batch import utility directly
node -r ts-node/register src/admin/batch-import-links.ts --file=path/to/links.csv --type=csv --generate-tags --dry-run

# Or use the admin CLI
node -r ts-node/register src/admin/admin-cli.ts import --file=path/to/links.csv --type=csv --generate-tags
```

#### Options

- `--file`: Path to the CSV or JSON file containing links to import (required)
- `--type`: File type, either 'csv' or 'json' (required)
- `--generate-tags`: Generate tags for links using AI or local fallback (optional)
- `--dry-run`: Run the import without saving changes (optional)
- `--dataset`: Specify which dataset to use (default: 'default') (optional)

#### CSV Format

The CSV file should have the following columns:

```
title,url,description,category,subcategory,tags
"Example Link","https://example.com","This is an example","Resources","Tools","example,tool"
```

#### JSON Format

The JSON file should contain an array of link objects:

```json
[
  {
    "title": "Example Link",
    "url": "https://example.com",
    "description": "This is an example",
    "category": "Resources",
    "subcategory": "Tools",
    "tags": ["example", "tool"]
  }
]
```

### Recategorization Utility

The recategorization utility helps suggest and apply category/subcategory changes based on tags.

#### Usage

```bash
# Run the recategorization utility directly
node -r ts-node/register src/admin/recategorize-by-tags.ts --dry-run --interactive

# Or use the admin CLI
node -r ts-node/register src/admin/admin-cli.ts recategorize --dry-run --interactive
```

#### Options

- `--dry-run`: Show suggested changes without applying them (optional)
- `--interactive`: Confirm each change individually (optional)
- `--dataset`: Specify which dataset to use (default: 'default') (optional)

### Admin CLI

The admin CLI provides a unified interface for all admin utilities.

#### Usage

```bash
node -r ts-node/register src/admin/admin-cli.ts <command> [options]
```

#### Commands

- `import`: Run the batch import utility
- `recategorize`: Run the recategorization utility
- `backup`: Create a backup of the links data

### AI Tag Generation Configuration

The AI-powered tag generation feature uses OpenAI's GPT model by default but includes fallback mechanisms:

1. **OpenAI GPT**: Requires `OPENAI_API_KEY` in your environment variables
2. **REST API Fallback**: If OpenAI fails or no API key is provided
3. **Local Keyword Extraction**: Works offline with no external dependencies

To customize the AI tag generation behavior, you can modify the settings in `src/lib/auto-tagger.ts`:

```typescript
// Example configuration options
const AI_TAG_CONFIG = {
  maxTags: 5,           // Maximum number of tags to generate
  minConfidence: 0.7,   // Minimum confidence score for tag inclusion
  useOpenAI: true,      // Whether to use OpenAI as primary tagger
  useFallbackAPI: true, // Whether to use REST API as fallback
  colorPalette: [       // Colors for tag badges
    "blue", "green", "red", "yellow", "purple", "pink", "orange"
  ]
};
```

## ZAO Nexus × Hats Protocol Integration

A next-generation "Trusted Link Aggregator" playbook that integrates Hats Protocol at every layer of Nexus. Hats Protocol serves as a programmable reputation OS where every role, permission, or kudos gets minted as an on-chain "Hat," visible at hats.thezao.com and automatically reflected inside Nexus.

### 1. Hats Foundation Layer

- **Hat Registry UI (hats.thezao.com)**
  - Fork the Hats Protocol dashboard; pre-load "Curator," "Moderator," "Builder," "Partner DAO," "Service Provider," etc.
  - Anyone can apply for a Hat or be nominated by an existing Hat-holder
  - Gives every contributor a cryptographically provable badge wired to smart-contract permissions

- **Hat-gated Feature Flags**
  - Nexus checks the user's Hats on page-load:
    - Curator Hat ⇒ can submit links
    - Moderator Hat ⇒ can approve/remove
    - Builder Hat ⇒ can run CLI/import tools
    - Partner Hat ⇒ gets a "Trusted Source" label
  - Permissions live on-chain—not in a hidden database—so any dApp can reuse them

### 2. Verifiable Trust Layer

- **EAS-attested Links + Hat Signature**
  - When a Curator submits a link, the attestation includes their Hat ID
  - Nexus badge = ✅ Verified by Curator #123
  - Creates an auditable trail of who vouched for what

- **Hat Slashing / Suspension Hooks**
  - If a Moderator removes a Curator's malicious link, the Curator Hat can be auto-suspended until DAO review
  - Keeps quality high without centralized gatekeepers

### 3. Farcaster Mini-App Surface

- **"Hat-Filtered" Nexus Frame**
  - Mini-App shows only links attested by wallets holding Curator or higher Hats
  - Drop-downs let users toggle by Hat type
  - Makes it obvious which resources are DAO-vetted vs community-submitted

- **Hat-earned Cast Flair**
  - When the Mini-App posts an auto-receipt cast, it adds the Curator's Hat emoji (🎩) + ID
  - Social proof travels with the share

### 4. Storage & Portability

- **Hat-indexed Subgraph**
  - The Graph indexes LinkAttested events and WearHat events
  - External devs can fetch links by Hat tier
  - Any hackathon team can instantly build "Top Partner DAO Tools," etc.

### 5. Community-Driven Curation

- **Quadratic Votes Weighted by Hat Seniority**
  - Votes = √(tokens) × HatLevel (e.g., Moderator = 1.5×)
  - Balances stake-weighting with earned reputation

- **DAO "Dispute & Remove" with Hat Quorum**
  - A challenge needs 3+ Moderators or 1 Council Hat to pass
  - Slashes the challenger's bond if frivolous
  - Formalizes governance without manual Discord drama

### 6. Builder-First UX

- **Hat-aware CLI (npx zao-nexus)**
  - CLI auto-detects your Hats; shows commands you're allowed to run
  - Devs never hit a 403 surprise

- **Hat-sync GitHub Action**
  - A repo's links.yaml gets pushed nightly
  - Action signs with the repo owner's Hat-bound key → attestation
  - Allows teams to keep working in Git while still feeding Nexus

### 7. Intelligence Layer

- **Hat-based Recommendations**
  - "Builders who wear the Toolsmith Hat also bookmarked…"
  - Surfaces context-relevant links instead of generic popularity

### 8. Future Experiments

- **Hat Crafting & Leveling**
  - Curator submits 10 approved links → upgrades to Senior Curator Hat (extra weight, new UI palette)
  - Gamifies long-term contribution

- **Cross-DAO Hat Federation**
  - Accept Nouns' "Prop House Judge Hat" or Optimism's "Badge of Merit" as equivalent to Curator Hat via Hats' cross-domain attestation feature
  - Extends Nexus trust graph beyond ZAO

- **Hat ↔ TBA Profile Fusion**
  - Issue an ERC-6551 TBA when a Hat is minted
  - The TBA wallet owns the Hat and the link list NFT
  - Each project's profile becomes a composable on-chain entity that other apps can permission against

## Advanced Filtering and AI Tagging

NEXUS V5 includes powerful filtering and AI-powered tagging capabilities to help users organize and discover links more effectively.

### Advanced Filtering

The `AdvancedFilters` component provides comprehensive filtering options:

- **Date Range**: Filter links by when they were added with calendar popovers and quick-select buttons
- **Popularity**: Filter by popularity score using a slider control
- **Read Status**: Filter by read, unread, or all links
- **Attachments**: Toggle to show only links with attachments
- **Tags**: Select from common tags to filter the link collection
- **Domains**: Filter by specific domains with add/remove functionality

The filters can be accessed through the sidebar on desktop or via a slide-in panel on mobile devices.

### AI-Powered Tagging

The AI tagging system automatically generates relevant tags for new links:

1. **Content Analysis**: When a new link is added, the system fetches and analyzes the webpage content
2. **Metadata Extraction**: Title, description, and main content are extracted
3. **AI Processing**: The content is processed using OpenAI's GPT model to suggest relevant tags
4. **Fallback Mechanisms**: If AI processing fails, the system falls back to keyword extraction
5. **Tag Management**: Users can add, remove, and filter by tags through the intuitive UI

### Using the Demo

To try out the advanced filtering and AI tagging features:

1. Navigate to `/demo/enhanced-filtering` in the application
2. Click "Add Link" to add a new link with AI-generated tags
3. Use the filter sidebar to explore different filtering options
4. Try selecting tags to filter the link collection

## Implementation Roadmap

### ☑️ Phase 0.5 – Observability Foundation (add **before** anything else)  
1. **Event Schema**  
   - Track: `link_add`, `vote_cast`, `share_click`, `preview_hover`, `hat_minted`, `hat_slash`.  
   - Fields: `txHash?`, `wallet`, `hatId?`, `linkId?`, `timestamp`, `meta` (JSON).  
2. **Logging Hook**  
   - Emit events client-side → `/api/telemetry` (POST).  
   - Serverless function streams to **Supabase** or **Tinybird** table.  
3. **Dashboard Stub**  
   - Spin up a lightweight **Grafana** panel or **Dune** query showing daily counts per event.  
   - Expose at `/admin/analytics` (basic auth).

### 🚀 Phase 1 – Quick Wins + Hat Readiness (Weeks 1-4)  
- **Clipboard fallback**, **share badges**, **sorting**, **recently-visited**, **hover preview**.  
- **Hat-gated Feature Flags**  
  - Read-only check: wallet → `HatsProtocol.getHats(address)` → boolean flags.  
  - Gate UI buttons (`AddLink`, `ModerateLink`) based on Hat status.  
- **Link-Health Cron**  
  - Daily `GET` on all URLs; mark `dead=true` if 3 consecutive 404/timeout.  
  - Surface `dead` flag in UI (strikethrough + "Report issue" link).

### 🔄 Phase 2 – Core Sharing & Taxonomy (Weeks 5-12)  
- Complete **Enhanced Sharing** suite (Web Share API, QR, `zao.link` shortener).  
- **Improved Tag System** (multi-select filter, tag chips, `/tags/:tag` pages).  
- **EAS-attested Links v0**  
  1. Curator Hat can mint attestation (`schemaId = LinkSchemaV1`).  
  2. UI shows ✅ "Attested" badge when `EAS.getAttestation(linkId)` returns truthy.

### ⚙️ Phase 3 – On-chain Governance & Social Surface (Weeks 13-24)  
- **Hat Registry UI**  
  - Mint / transfer / suspend flows via Hats Protocol SDK.  
- **Quadratic Voting + Dispute Flow**  
  - Contract: `LinkVotes.sol`, `DisputeResolver.sol`.  
  - Front-end widgets for up-vote, bond challenge, moderator quorum.  
- **Subgraph + Farcaster Frame**  
  - Deploy Graph Node indexing `LinkAttested`, `VoteCast`, `WearHat`.  
  - Mini-app (`/frames/top-links`) pulls from subgraph & filters by Hat tiers.

### 🌐 Phase 4 – Ecosystem & Advanced Features (Week 25+)  
- **Cross-DAO Hat Federation**, **TBA profile fusion**, **AI recommendations**, **IPFS/Arweave snapshots**, etc.  
- Only begin once analytics show:  
  - ≥ 100 Curator Hats minted  
  - Average weekly active voters ≥ 50  
  - Link-health "dead" ratio < 2 %

---

### ✅ Definition of Done (per phase)  
1. **All unit + integration tests pass.**  
2. **Telemetry dashboards show expected event flow.**  
3. **Manual QA checklist in `/docs/QA_PHASE_X.md` is signed off.**  
4. **Changelog updated + version tag pushed.**
